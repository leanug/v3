          We start with a short call to align on goals and scope. 
          If you prefer, you can also send a detailed brief by email. 
          I'll review it and reply with a clear proposal, pricing, and timeline.

          Landing pages usually take 1 to 2 weeks. Multi-page sites take 2 to 4 weeks.

        <div class="collapse-content text-sm leading-relaxed">
          Payments are handled via <span class="font-semibold">PayPal</span>. 
          Projects begin with a 50% upfront payment, 
          with the remaining 50% due before final delivery.

            We begin with an initial brief to define goals, scope, and expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I create a moodboard to establish visual direction and overall aesthetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I move into wireframes to define structure and user flow before visual design begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            After approval, I design the full UI with refined visuals and interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If required, I handle development in Framer, Webflow, or Astro.

            You will receive regular updates throughout the entire process.

          What's your revision policy?

        <div class="collapse-content text-sm leading-relaxed">
          Revisions are included during the wireframe phase to lock structure. 
          After final design, 1 to 2 major revision rounds are included. 
          Additional revisions are billed at my hourly rate.

          Payments are non refundable once the project has started. The initial deposit is non refundable, as time and production capacity are reserved specifically for each project.
