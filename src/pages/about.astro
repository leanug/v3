        What Led Me Here
      </h1>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content/70">
        I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content/70">
        I started in web development in 2008, building MySpace layouts. By 2010, I built and maintained a network of Flash game websites that attracted significant traffic, using PHP, MySQL, and HTML.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content/70">
        In 2012, I transitioned to WordPress and freelancing, collaborating remotely with a local web development studio to build WordPress websites and WooCommerce powered eCommerce platforms.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content/70">
        Along the way, I built several web applications. Many never launched or gained traction. I also spent eight months building a game that I never released. Still, those projects taught me how to ship, test, and iterate.     
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-base-content/70">
        Over time, I expanded into React, Framer, Webflow, and UI design, steadily building a strong foundation in both development and product design.
