        What Led Me Here
      </h2>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
I first got into web development in 2008, trying to start a MySpace layout business. The problem was, I wasn't a great designer and I quickly realized I couldn't compete with what was already out there. So I quit, leaving my half-finished website behind.      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Around 2010, I built a network of Flash game websites that ended up getting a good amount of traffic. I used plain PHP, MySQL, and HTML, and learned a lot just by doing. Things changed in 2012 after Google shifted its algorithm, and I had to start over. That's when I got into WordPress and freelancing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Over time, I picked up React, Webflow, and a bit of UI design along the way. It's been a slow build, full of trial and error, but that's how I've learned most of what I know.
      </p>

        What I'm Working On
      </h2>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        These days, I mostly work as a freelance Webflow developer, helping clients launch clean, responsive websites.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'm also diving deeper into Framer and Astro.js to explore different ways of building faster, smoother sites.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My current goal is to launch a few premium template stores, where I can put everything I've learned into practiceâ€”clean UI, solid performance, and subtle interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        To promote those sites, I'm also building a YouTube channel (@scriptingpixels) where I share web development and design tutorials. It's a way to document what I've learned, reach more people, and build an audience around the work I'm doing.
