        What Led Me Here
      </h1>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-300">
        I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-300">
        I first got into web development in 2008, trying to start a MySpace layout business. The problem was, I wasn't a great designer and I quickly realized I couldn't compete with what was already out there. So I quit, leaving my half-finished website behind.

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-300">
        Around 2010, I built a network of Flash game websites that ended up getting a good amount of traffic. I used plain PHP, MySQL, and HTML, and learned a lot just by doing. Things changed in 2012 after Google shifted its algorithm, and I had to start over. That's when I got into WordPress and freelancing.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-300">
        Over time, I picked up React, Webflow, and a bit of UI design along the way. It's been a slow build, full of trial and error, but that's how I've learned most of what I know.
