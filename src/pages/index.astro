        I'm a developer and designer focused on building clean, 
        high-performing websites with a strong emphasis on usability and design precision. 
        I care about crafting interfaces that are both functional and beautiful, 
        the kind users don't have to think twice about.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with both code and no-code tools, depending on the 
        project's needs. I'm comfortable in Figma and at home in the 
        frontend, where I pay attention to the details that shape the
        user experience. Whether it's a marketing site, product UI, or 
        landing page, I aim for a balance of speed, clarity, and aesthetics.
