<h2 class="mb-4 font-medium">About</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Germany is facing a shortage of skilled workers. Meetovo is a web application that enables companies to attract candidates through customizable career pages and manage the entire hiring process from a centralized dashboard.
</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 font-medium mt-12">Task</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
Design new dashboard screens, menus, and modals while respecting the existing interface built with Ant Design 4.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
The goal was to expand product functionality, support new user flows, and create high-fidelity prototypes to clearly validate interactions and workflows.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Duration: 1 month
</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 mt-12 font-medium">Process</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
All work was developed within the Ant Design 4 design system, making subtle adjustments to ensure consistency with the existing Meetovo web app.
</p>

<p class="mb-12">
The focus was on maintaining a simple, intuitive, and distraction-free interface, using subtle colors and clear hierarchy to reduce friction in recruitment workflows.
