          <p>I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay</p>
          <p>
            I started my journey in web development back in 2008 with MySpace, creating layouts and building my own website. At the time, I had zero visitors because I had no marketing skills and was still learning the ropes of design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010, I created a network of Flash game websites that received millions of visits, using PHP, MySQL and HTML5. However, everything changed in 2012 when Google altered its algorithms, leading me to transition to WordPress for theme development and freelance web design.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continued to grow, I learned React and Webflow and began working freelance, while also dabbling in a bit of UI design.

          What I'm Building Now
        </h2>
        <div class="max-w-3xl text-lg space-y-4 mx-auto">
          <p>
            Right now, I'm working as a freelance Webflow developer, 
            helping clients bring clean, modern designs to life on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I'm diving into Framer and Astro.js
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal? Launch a couple of premium template stores where I can 
            combine good UI, smooth interactions, and fast performance.
