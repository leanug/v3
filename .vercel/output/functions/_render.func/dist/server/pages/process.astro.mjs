Project Request
</h2> <div class="space-y-3 mt-5"> <p>
First, you send a quick project request. This helps me understand what 
            you need and see if we're a good fit.
</p> <p>
If it makes sense to move forward, we can hop on a video call or continue 
            the conversation through email or WhatsApp, whatever works best for you.

First Meeting
</h2> <div class="space-y-3 mt-5"> <p>
(Optional) If you prefer a quick face-to-face before we begin, 
            we can set up a short video call to go over your project, 
            goals, and expectations. It's a good way to make sure we're 
            on the same page and clarify anything upfront.
</p> <p>
Not into calls? That's totally fine, we can keep it all async via email or chat.

Proposal
</h2> <div class="space-y-3 mt-5"> <p>
Once I understand your project, I'll put together <b>a clear, 
            upfront proposal</b>, no hourly rates, just a flat project price 
            so you know exactly what to expect. No surprises, <b>just transparency.</b> </p> </div> </div> <div> <span class="text-sm">Step 04.</span> <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl">
Project Request

With everything in place, the real work begins. 
            I'll start building your project while keeping you updated along the way.

Expect clear communication and regular progress reports through Slack, 
            email, or whatever works best for you. No guesswork, just steady progress.
